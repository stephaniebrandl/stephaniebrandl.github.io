I am a tenture-track Assistant Professor at the Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science ([SODAS](https://sodas.ku.dk)) at the University of Copenhagen. I work on fairness and explainability in NLP, as well as the application of language models to research domains in the social science.

I grew up in [southwestern Germany](https://www.suedpfalz-tourismus.de/startseite.html?no_cache=1) at the border to France where the weather is good and people like to drink local wine out of [funny-looking glasses](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbeglas) while chatting and eating [tarte flambée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammekueche).  

I moved to Berlin to study mathematics and social science. 
There the sky is usually grey, there is no wine and people are mostly grumpy. 
Nevertheless, the city grew on me and I stayed a little longer to complete my PhD in 
Machine Learning at [TU Berlin](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/). 

In the midst of my PhD I realized that I find language even more exciting than the 
human brain which aligned well with [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io) in 
Copenhagen where I joined as a PostDoc in 2021. In Copenhagen, we don't talk about the weather and experience seasons based on the calendar instead of the temperature.
