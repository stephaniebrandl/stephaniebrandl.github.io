I grew up in [southwestern Germany](https://www.suedpfalz-tourismus.de/startseite.html?no_cache=1) at the border to France where the weather is good and people like to drink local wine out of [funny-looking glasses](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbeglas) while chatting and eating [tarte flamb√©e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammekueche).  

I moved to Berlin to study mathematics and social science. 
There the sky is usually grey, there is no wine and people are mostly grumpy. 
Nevertheless, the city grew on me and I stayed a little longer to complete my PhD in 
Machine Learning at [TU Berlin](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/). 

In the midst of my PhD I realized that I find language even more exciting than the 
human brain which aligned well with [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io) in 
Copenhagen where I joined as a PostDoc in 2021.  

I currently work on fairness and 
interpretability in NLP, also in combination with human reading (eye-tracking). 
I am most interested in making NLP equally accessible and transparent for everyone.  

I recently joined the [Center for Philosophy of AI](https://cpaicopenhagen.wordpress.com) 
where I get the chance for enlightening discussions about AI and hope to contribute to the field with a new perspective.
